This is a small sample of Lua based chess to run from command line.

1. GarboChess.bat - good port of chess engine to Lua
 (ported from javascript)

2. fruit21chess.bat - good port of Fruit chess engine to Lua
 (ported from C++)

3. EmulatedOliThink.bat - some kind of scientific port of 64bit strong chess engine -
   plays wrong moves because it is impossible to calculate millions of nodes on Lua required by algorithm.
 (ported from java)

4. c0_chess.bat - a lua library for chess

5. sargon.bat - Sargon assembler code of 80s ported to lua
   history at http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Dan+Spracklen
   Just fast and simply positional. Not strong, improvable.

6. LuaJester.bat - Very good chess program for 32-bits, and fast. Almost best what lua can perform.

7. JesterPureLua.bat - the same Jester without BitOp requirement,
   bitwises are little bit slower but working based on pure Lua scripts.
