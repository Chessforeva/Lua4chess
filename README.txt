This is a small sample of Lua based chess to run from command line.

1. GarboChess.bat - good port of chess engine to Lua
 (ported from javascript)

2. fruit21chess.bat - good port of Fruit chess engine to Lua
 (ported from C++)

3. EmulatedOliThink.bat - kind of scientific port of a 64bit chess engine.
  NOT a useful Lua chess AI. Anyway, interesting to see checkmate at the end:)

4. c0_chess.bat - a lua library for chess

5. sargon.bat - Sargon assembler code of 80s ported to lua
   history at http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Dan+Spracklen
   Just fast and simply positional. Not strong, improvable.

6. LuaJester.bat - Very good chess program for 32-bits, and fast. Almost best what lua can perform.

7. JesterPureLua.bat - the same Jester without BitOp requirement,
   bitwises are little bit slower but working based on pure Lua scripts.


Other:
---------

1. polybase.bat - a polyglot book reader sample

2. abkbase.bat - an Arena book reader sample



Also lua to loadfile:
---------------------
i64.lua - emulated 64bit variables to get working (1<<63)
c0_chess_subroutine.lua - chess logic, not a fastest code
